# Time-Series-analysis-for-Energy-Production
Electric and gas utility production was analysed and predicted result was compared using time series

The given dataset describes the industrial production in the United States from 1985 to 2019. 
These are the real measures values of the residents in United States.

**Dataset Frequency** - Monthly 

**Units** - Index 2012=100

**Implementation** : Initially the dataset was imported and visualized the current status of the energy production. Further to observe the trend rolling mean statistics and Dickey Fuller Test was being done. As the upward trend was seen, AR, MA models were applied to see the results. Finally by trial and error process ARIMA model was being applied and the energy production was estimated. All the processing done is very well supported with visual images.
